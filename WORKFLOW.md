You are working on a TianGong LCA data import task.

Task ID: {{ issue.identifier }} Title: {{ issue.title }}

Body: {{ issue.description }}

## Classify

Use the Skills-owned `foundry-tidas-import` entry for an installed public task and load `foundry-tidas-authoring` only for a current semantic work item. These instructions document the underlying Foundry owner pipeline; source commands are not substitutes for the public task's registered actions.

CLI-managed package execution now completes trusted host admission before workspace operations. Runtime launch policy selects workspace read/write access and an independently bound runtime target; task/actor/account intent and restricted-action permission checks remain separate. Direct installed calls without a managed host keep their existing local preparation behavior.

Migration transfer planning is governed by [the workspace migration contract](docs/workspace-migration-contract.md). W10 provides explicit source/queue/input staging, current-owner task adoption, audited v2 activation and separate runtime read/write selection. Preserved history blocks replay across requests and migrations; none of these records grants business permission. Operational qualification and release integration remain tracked in #108/#980.

The v2 task store persists registered job/source/profile identity, account intent, producer receipts and artifact lineage; deterministic local retries reuse verified results. Exact C1/TIDAS qualification, all-command disposition, derived authorization and child admission form the W04 authority boundary. The W05 hierarchical facade adds strict result/task schemas, deterministic request revisions, actor-bound status/resume, local preparation and read-only migration inventory. W06 owns the installable candidate closure; W08 owns F1 publication and platform components. See `docs/public-runtime-contract.md`, `docs/runtime-context-contract.md`, `docs/task-authorization-contract.md` and `docs/foundry-task-contracts.md`.

For consumer workspace execution, follow `docs/public-runtime-contract.md`. Use `workspace init`, `doctor`, `task start`, `task status`, `task resume` and `workspace migrate --dry-run` with `--json`. Task specs own request/actor/lane/profile/source/seed/account/preparation intent and an optional concise brief; status and resume require the same explicit actor. When a current blocker needs user judgment, the Skills entry explains the missing facts, effect and recommended next step plainly, registers the question and raw answer through `--interaction-input`, and continues independent work. A choice for one object must carry its exact current registered row hash, identity and version; task/type-wide choices remain explicit. Status identifies the affected object and exposes separate current authoring context for independent objects. Initial answers still permit local assessment; every narrow answer needs indexed adoption before authorization or execution, and an unproven changed row cannot inherit an old choice. Authorization and owner execution recheck current interaction evidence; after indexed authorization, changed choices require a separately reviewed task revision. Incomplete assessment coverage cannot finalize. A completed task provides a derived decision recap without another approval step. Start and local preparation require no login. Execute only returned structured argv actions with their recorded CWD/binding; never run display text. A nonempty attempt state is readback-only, and W10 alone may apply a migration plan.

Choose one lane:

- `external-dataset-curated-import`: packaged LCA data supported by unified Rust `tidas import`.
- `source-evidence-dataset-development`: PDF, Excel, screenshot, web page, markdown, image, or free text that must be authored into TIDAS candidate rows.

## Toolchain Preflight

Use Node.js 24 and the repository-pinned `pnpm@11.24.0`. TypeScript `7.0.2` is the sole compiler, Oxlint is the linter, and Prettier is the formatter. TypeScript must keep `erasableSyntaxOnly`; Git-enumerated `.ts`/`.mts`/`.cts` files must all appear in the intentional first-party Oxlint and typecheck graphs, while tracked `.jsx`/`.tsx` are forbidden in this non-JSX control plane. Root lint ignores nested Oxlint configs, bans `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-nocheck`/`@ts-expect-error`, and runs the comment-aware native-disable audit before Oxlint, so inline suppression cannot bypass zero-any or erasable-syntax enforcement. Suppression inventory and temp-repository fixtures clear inherited repository-local Git variables before selecting their target root. The build removes stale `dist` output before compiling and emits nothing on TypeScript diagnostics; it does not promise atomic recovery from arbitrary filesystem failure. Source and emitted commands must resolve the same trusted root, use their active `.ts`/`.js` entry for nested argv, and remain equivalent from an unrelated CWD. Do not create npm/Yarn lockfiles, TypeScript 5/6 aliases, or compiler-API lint/format bridges.

Keep the permanent `test/unit/zero-javascript-ratchet.test.mts` green: tracked first-party JavaScript, compatibility compiler includes, and mixed JS test/lint globs remain at zero. Drive changes with focused characterization, a realistic case, and full validation.

For explicit-any cleanup, pair the existing behavior cases with a focused contract that runs the installed Oxlint `typescript/no-explicit-any` AST rule through `process.execPath`; do not depend on a TypeScript compiler API that the pinned TypeScript 7 package does not expose. All production, test and configuration TypeScript must remain at zero explicit `any`. The repository-wide rule is global and must not be weakened with target-specific overrides; focused family contracts remain useful characterization, not coverage exceptions.

Queue authoring context must preserve manifest and JSONL encounter order, exact-version selection before id-only fallback, closure dependency/support order and native parse/filesystem/invalid-dependency failures. Missing or malformed queue evidence must not be converted into an executable or remote-write allowance.

Full-context package and decision-task proof must remain bound to exact file bytes, recorded hashes and non-empty required context. Shared context follows embedded task context in the existing order; missing, malformed, hash-drifted or incomplete proof remains blocking and cannot be converted into remote-write authority.

Decision-task and identity-preflight artifact helpers must keep concrete queue, context, proof, request and source-index contracts with `unknown` narrowed at JSON/dependency boundaries. Preserve selection and dedupe order, stable queue/context hashes, exact CommandSpec artifact facts, first-bound source indexes and native fail-close behavior; typing these local artifacts must not absorb Edge search or CLI execution authority.

Classification decision apply context must preserve the apply report's decision/task order, exact resolved input/output paths and content hashes. A missing decision file stays empty, while malformed readable JSON or an invalid path type retains its native failure; evidence aggregation never executes decisions.

Profile normalization and lookup must preserve configured profile order, alias precedence, requested/default/generic fallback and base-before-operator additions. A TypeScript migration cannot invent a waiver, broaden an account-local override or change the generic/BAFU/USLCI/worldsteel defaults.

Patch collection remains an admission gate: every non-test operation needs a valid pointer, allowed resolution, evidence and required action closure. Annual-supply deferral, unresolved templates, incomplete full-context proof, trace mismatches and malformed readable artifacts must remain fail-closed before patch apply or mutation planning.

Identity decision context may close an action only from a completed, matching decision and may surface reusable canonical identity only from the established decision value and aliases. File ordering, package proof, payload hashes, rewrite evidence and unresolved-flow keys remain bound evidence for later gates.

Patch apply and trace evidence must remain bound to the exact row identity/index, payload hashes, resolution mode and closure codes. Deterministic cleanup substitutes only when owner, status, identity, row, trace hash and exchange signatures all match; otherwise reference closure remains blocked.

Deterministic row-lineage acceptance requires an exact or content-equivalent starting artifact followed by an explicit transform chain to the expected rows. First-seen transform order, status gates and payload hashes remain evidence; unreachable or malformed chains do not become freshness or write proof.

Dry-run artifacts and exact-scope evidence remain separate checks: dry-run readers preserve per-command success/failure facts, while evidence-scope rejects missing or mismatched schema, curation, cleanup, patch, dry-run and remote reports unless an explicit deterministic transform chain proves the same final rows.

Decision full-context, patch authoring, semantic actions, patch evidence, and identity-preflight now execute from native TypeScript. The three authoring modules form one characterized SCC and must cross migration/build boundaries atomically. Preserve action/trace/blocker encounter order, shared-context and authoring-package hashes, exact-version identity lookup before id-only fallback, execution-receipt and target-payload freshness checks, source-context requirements, and native parse/filesystem failures; missing or stale evidence never becomes AI completion or write authority.

The authoring facade/runner layer is also native TypeScript. Facades must re-export the exact live owner functions without wrappers. Package builds preserve gate-entry order, snapshot filename SHA, source bytes, task directory names and manifest/JSONL bytes. Patch collection preserves blocker class and task order, then patch-file, patch-set and operation order; malformed task JSON is reported as a blocker, malformed manifest JSON retains its native failure, and a fresh batch is written only when blockers are empty.

The curation planning boundary is native TypeScript as well. Its aggregate facade must retain exact owner references; the gate runner preserves row-derived entity order, blocker families, context files, authoring packages and report aliases/bytes; cleanup preserves deep-cloned row order, deterministic annual-supply/trace/source-exchange transformations, JSONL bytes and complete counts. Missing or malformed local evidence remains blocking or raises the existing native error, and none of these modules execute remote operations.

The task/completion, commit-handoff/identity-task, and support-cache command owners are native TypeScript. Preserve queue and closeout order, exact task/report/snapshot bytes, final-row artifact facts, authoritative CommandSpec argv, identity action dedupe, support-cache paging and row order, and every established blocker/native error. Credential-bearing support refresh remains a read-only operator command; ordinary tests must use local HTTP stubs and must not read `.env` or access production.

The mutation reference stack is native TypeScript. Preserve reference DFS and table resolution, planned-self/public-remote/proven/unresolved/foreign closure partitions, explicit-before-default source rewrite selection, public-canonical source proof filtering, write/reference/blocked item order and report/items bytes. A blocked manifest must keep write-candidates empty; rendered plans and evidence never become mutation authority.

The high-level dataset orchestration layer is native TypeScript. `library-scope-workflow.ts` stays profile-agnostic; BAFU classification, auto-authoring, process-scope and batch owners retain their established BAFU defaults, while USLCI and Worldsteel wrappers delegate into the shared typed batch engine. Preserve exact content/policy/executable resume ledgers, compact consumed-attempt state, pause/stop and bounded-parallel selection, read-only preflight, exact scope/library/identity/classification gate order, local artifact bytes, shell-free argv and receipt/hash binding. Only the existing explicit `--commit` path may reach a guarded CLI handoff.

For `dataset-process-scope-run --commit`, each ready scope's retained `commit_command` / `verify_command` value must be an artifact-bound CommandSpec object produced by the existing finalize/handoff chain. Raw arrays are invalid. The public CLI validates spec authority and artifact bytes immediately before every shell-free spawn; commit is attempted at most once, verify follows only a successful commit, and display text is never executed. The locked CLI batch engine owns actual bounded concurrency, exclusive process keys, pause/stop and exception isolation. Foundry binds the complete scope JSON, spec SHAs, policy and exact installed CLI package, then writes results in input order.

Library canonical descriptions are authoritative JSON evidence. Before changing a process reference, `canonical-description.ts` must validate and clone the selected string/object/array; the exact multilingual object/array then remains identical in the process reference and rewrite ledger and through batch resolution, identity apply, later process rewrite, and BAFU carry-forward. Never call `String(...)`/`asText(...)` on object-valued canonical evidence. Scalar strings keep their existing representation; cyclic, unsupported, sparse, accessor-backed, or otherwise non-JSON values fail before payload mutation.

Within BAFU auto-authoring, an exact product/waste-flow name never overrides the physical review. `identity-equivalence.ts` may return an exact reuse candidate only when its ordered non-equivalence reasons are empty; property, unit, geography/market, category/route, technology, or physical-meaning conflicts remain in decision evidence and produce `create_new` rather than `reuse_existing_reference`. Matching exact-flow evidence, elementary land-use special cases, and process exact-name explicit review remain characterized separately.

BAFU category-map projection must evaluate every supplied decision row, not only categories referenced by the current task set. `category-map-report.ts` owns closure-wide status and blocker projection. A non-empty emitted category-map/process/flow-product manual-review closure requires `completed_with_manual_review`, a blocker naming the exact source/reason/artifact, and a nonzero CLI exit. Do not continue library decisions apply from shell success alone; resolve the referenced manual-review rows and rerun. A blocker-free report remains byte-identical to the prior `completed` contract.

Post-finalize identity and semantic recovery reports must expose the exact executed command authority. Each stage records a `command` object with authoritative `executable` and complete `argv` plus derived non-authoritative `display`; no option may be reconstructed after execution or omitted on error/missing-report paths. `runProjectedArgvStage` is the only dispatch/projection path. If the returned projection differs by executable, argv value/order, display, field set, or key order, stop before the next recovery stage.

After a location decision task is ready, resolve its generated location queue exactly once. Bind the relative path, byte length, and SHA-256 before suggestion; use that bound path for both suggestion and apply. Re-read only the bound artifact fact after suggestion—never rediscover a queue. Missing content, changed bytes/hash, or relative-path drift must stop at `location.queue.verify` with expected/observed evidence before `dataset-location-decisions-apply` is constructed.

Within the process and shared batch owners, same-id/version lost-success recovery is governed by `scripts/lib/same-identity-commit-recovery.ts`. A failure may enter recovery only when its structured evidence contains explicit code `23505` and exact same-id/version conflict semantics; display text alone, mixed or malformed failures, and missing detail remain blocking. The commit mutation is dispatched at most once and never replayed. Its status remains `readback_recovery_pending` until the existing content-bound verifier proves exact owner, state, identity, version, payload, and root closure; missing, unexpected, foreign, mismatched, or exhausted readback cannot reach closeout.

Within the shared batch owner, `scripts/lib/batch-orchestration/post-write-handoff.ts` owns the asynchronous commit → post-write verify/retry → closeout stage. It applies that shared recovery classifier, retries only classified read-only verification failures, and closes only after the final exact verification report succeeds. The module receives the existing stage runner and never executes rendered display text.

The enclosing per-dataset state machine lives in `scripts/lib/batch-orchestration/scope-finalize-commit.ts`. It serializes support commits across concurrent scopes, reuses only verified support identities, invalidates stale reuse before a fresh support handoff, reruns finalize on exact recovered rows/evidence, and invokes the main handoff only from `ready_for_remote_write`. A missing finalize report or failed support handoff remains blocking.

CLI wrappers, execution-capsule admission, and post-write closeout are native TypeScript. Wrappers must pass executable plus argv arrays directly, retain the existing environment/CWD/stdout/stderr/exit contract, and surface native spawn errors without executing display text. Capsule admission stays offline and unattempted until exact external dispatch evidence exists. Closeout stays read-only and requires one exact owner/state/payload readback per intended root; production-test mode accepts no traceHash normalization, and foreign or RLS-hidden missing rows never pass.

Core commands, the identity-preflight runner, and post-authoring finalize are native TypeScript. Core must retain runtime directory, workflow, storage, environment, surface, route, doctor and exact help behavior. Identity preflight must keep receipt-bound executable/argv arrays, request/target/binding hashes, positive-only cache reuse, stale disk and stdout/disk mismatch failures, nonzero exit handling and only-pending fail-close without a shell. Finalize must preserve identity/source/contact/canonical rewrite order, cleanup and validation gates, mutation evidence and read-only commit-handoff preparation; a blocked prerequisite never becomes dry-run or write authority.

The identity, classification, and location decision command factories are native TypeScript. Preserve their existing option aliases and defaults, queue/task/path encounter order, exact help and report bytes, decision-context and unclosed-queue blockers, deterministic classification/location CLI argv, stage failure short-circuiting, and identity read-only output split. Validation blockers must prevent owner-command stages; missing or malformed local artifacts retain native failures, and no factory gains direct remote-write authority.

The import-curation leaf, index, and public entry barrels are native TypeScript and must remain pure direct re-exports. Preserve the exact namespace keys and live function identity through both source and emitted Node 24 modules; do not add wrappers, initialization, hidden state, alternate owners, or a parallel `.mjs` entry. The CLI injection keys and metadata owner modules remain the authoritative command-consumer topology.

The TIDAS adapter, finalize utility boundary, cutover audit and Golden harness are native TypeScript. Preserve direct executable-plus-argv invocation, operation/version/hash reports, finalize rewrite/reuse/freshness order, authoritative Git inventory JSON/exit, and non-HEAD Node-native Golden comparison. Golden baseline/current children receive one byte-identical allowlisted environment with isolated HOME/temp/config state and filesystem env loading disabled; ambient credentials and live `.env` state are never forwarded. Tests use only controlled fake executables and local Git/filesystem fixtures.

All shared fixtures are native TypeScript. Keep `foundry-core.ts`, `row-builders.ts`, full-context/identity/mutation fixtures and incremental/topology packages deterministic and worktree-local. `fake-tidas.ts` must be invoked through `process.execPath` plus its script argv, never through an executable bit, shell, or platform-specific launcher; fixtures must not read credentials, `.env`, production state, or ignored historical artifacts.

All unit suites are native `.test.mts`. Preserve the exact existing cases before and after each rename, keep shared fixture imports on `.ts`, and use explicit narrowing or test-local dependency casts only where the runtime owner still exposes a JavaScript-shaped boundary. Unit-test typing must not modify owner behavior, profile defaults, Worldsteel/Date.parse semantics, or remote authority.

All scenario suites are native `.test.mts`. Preserve every multi-command artifact, row and blocker order, content hash, native error, fail-closed stage and remote-write boundary before and after rename. Shared recursive report typing is test-only; runtime owners and production validation remain authoritative.

`pnpm golden:diff` compares the current worktree with a non-`HEAD` merge-base using Node-native file comparison; CI must fetch full history. Test-only TypeScript executable overrides are dispatched as `process.execPath + script path`, never as platform-native binaries. Keep the root `.gitattributes` LF policy intact so Windows, macOS, and Linux format checks consume identical text.

Do not parse or execute rendered command strings. `tiangong-foundry.command-spec.v1` makes `executable` plus `argv` authoritative and keeps `display` reader-only. Its SHA-256 binds the authoritative command and exact artifact facts; commit and verify both bind the final rows path, bytes, and SHA-256, and runners reject same-path drift before `shell=false` spawn. Artifact-to-scope matching still normalizes platform separators. Durable writers fsync writable file descriptors, not read-only reopened handles.

Use the exact installed project dependency as `pnpm exec tiangong-lca ...`. Foundry runtime adapters resolve that same `@tiangong-lca/cli@0.1.27` manifest and bin directly; only the external `skills@latest` source-evidence resolver remains intentionally floating, with the resolved ref recorded in task artifacts.

The npm candidate is built through `pnpm package:build` and checked through `pnpm package:check`; `pnpm package:pack` archives only the generated sanitized stage. The installed `tiangong-foundry` bin accepts the six public facade operations and never routes a flat developer command. Package installation performs no initialization, login, component download or hook setup. Treat the W06 tarball as a local candidate until W08 publishes the exact F1 release and product manifest.

Reusable scheduling/run-lock, receipt parsing and runtime identity come only from `@tiangong-lca/cli/batch`, `@tiangong-lca/cli/auth-identity-receipt` and `@tiangong-lca/cli/runtime`. Never restore a `dist/src/**` import or expose CLI test internals; fixture receipt construction is test-only and must pass the same public parser before it can drive a case.

Credential-scoped operator commands must run through `pnpm account:run -- <profile> -- <executable> [args...]`. The ignored profile must include `FOUNDRY_EXPECTED_PROJECT_REF` and `FOUNDRY_EXPECTED_USER_ID`. Before the requested argv is executed, the wrapper obtains a fresh `auth identity-receipt` from the installed CLI with both expectations, requires a fresh intent-bound server-verified OAuth receipt while the CLI owns session reuse and refresh, and uses a restricted child environment. Missing expectations, thread-guard drift, stale or partial receipts, and the retired `--no-auth-check` path all fail before the requested command starts.

## Required Order

1. Create or reuse `.foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/`.
2. Freeze the source package or source document manifest.
3. Fetch SDK-backed contract context before AI repair or authoring:

```bash
pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset context-pack \
  --type <process|flow|source|contact|lifecyclemodel> \
  --profile ai-import \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/context/<type> \
  --json
```

4. For packaged imports, convert with `node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-tidas-import --input <source> --output <conversion-dir>`. The adapter delegates format detection/import/conversion to Rust `tidas`, accepts compatible 0.2.x or 0.3.x binaries, and enforces the stable operation report and exit contract. Keep the generated `process-bundles/index.json`; this is the generic package-level process-closure manifest used to build or shard downstream entity queues. Bundle `manifest` and `tidas_dir` entries may be relative to the bundle index directory and must be resolved before scope execution.
5. For source-document authoring, extract source evidence first and keep unresolved assumptions explicit. For document fulltext extraction, resolve the latest `document-granular-decompose` skill from `https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills` with `pnpm dlx skills@latest use https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills --skill document-granular-decompose --full-depth` before parsing the source file. For SCI paper or scientific journal evidence, resolve the latest `tiangong-kb-sci-search` skill from the same repository before retrieval. Then write `.foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/runtime-skills/runtime-skill-resolution.json` with the `pnpm dlx skills` command, the `git ls-remote https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills.git refs/heads/main` commit, skill name, timestamp, and evidence channel. Runtime-installed shared skills may live under `.agents/skills`, but their directories and `skills-lock.json` stay untracked unless the task explicitly chooses pinned reproducibility.
6. Validate generated rows with `node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-tidas-validate --rows-file <rows> --type <type> --out-dir <schema-dir>`.
7. Run deterministic QA with `pnpm exec tiangong-lca qa <type>`.
8. Build the entity-level import curation queue:

```bash
pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue build \
  --processes <process-rows.jsonl> \
  --flows <flow-rows.jsonl> \
  --support <source-or-contact-rows.jsonl> \
  --external-flow-ref <external-flow-ref-rows.jsonl> \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/curation-queue
```

The queue state machine belongs to `pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue build/next/verify`. It writes task, lock, blocker, closure, input, run-plan, and queue status artifacts; it does not run AI or write the database.

After build, workers should call `pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue next --queue-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/curation-queue --json` and execute only the returned task. Before write planning, call `pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue verify --queue-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/curation-queue --type <support|flow|process> --json`.

Batch runners may execute multiple ready tasks in parallel only when queue locks and `depends_on` checkpoints prove independence. The task workspace must record configured `max_parallelism` and the runner identity for each claimed task. A blocked task must write its blocker artifact and release unrelated work; it must not stop independent ready tasks from completing, committing, and passing readback when their exact scopes have no blockers. Any workflow stage that defers scopes must write a complete `blocked-scope-ledger.jsonl` plus a reader-facing `blocked-scope-report.json` that names the concrete reasons, affected process scopes, blocking dependency types or examples, required human action, and rerun command.

The high-level scope runner uses `cli-bounded-batch-runner.ts` for one public CLI run contract and cross-process lock, then `foundry-scope-batch-runner.ts` for per-family exclusive keys, bounded claims, pause-before-claim, stop-after-blocked, event delivery, mutation readback recovery, and mandatory in-flight drain. Before a scope is skipped, its bundle/shared bytes, options, stage/CommandSpec policy, and exact CLI package must match the retained contract. Legacy or drifting verified/blocked rows are invalidated; repaired blocker authority is selected again. Process finalize checkpoints additionally bind current report bytes, and Flow reuse requires the same canonical payload SHA. A consumed incomplete mutation may run readback recovery but must never dispatch a second mutation attempt. The callback remains Foundry-owned and writes checkpoints, verified/blocked/retry/ambiguous ledgers, compact attempt state, cache-cap effects, and the reader report; do not add a second worker-index claim loop.

After a scope reaches verified state, `scope-control-retention.ts` must finish before scratch deletion. It projects report/plan/log/ledger controls, stores exact bytes once under the run-level SHA-256 store, records original and store locators separately, marks large row/payload artifacts `pruned_payload` with bytes/SHA but no retained blob, writes the self-hashed receipt into the scope report, and verifies every required blob after deletion. Hardlink is an optimization only; copy fallback has identical verification. Missing controls, invalid prior receipt, blob drift, repository/store escape, or any symlink yields a blocked prune report and preserves scratch. Failed or ambiguous scopes are never passed to verified pruning. Shared-context cache eviction is recomputable-only, performs the same ownership/symlink preflight, and writes `shared-context-cache-prune-report.json`.

Before AI curation for process/flow imports, audit and then run the generated identity-preflight request index. The audit checks the exact `flow_hybrid_search` / `process_hybrid_search` Edge request body before any remote call: Edge only parses `query`, `filter`/`filter_condition`, match/page options, and `data_source`, so complete identity and source evidence must be present in the compact fielded `query`. Foundry may include `remote_candidate_search.profile_hints` in the request for source-derived facts such as elementary categories, flow property, reference unit, geography, reference flow names, technology, and system boundary; the CLI uses those hints only for local target profiling and candidate scoring, not as Edge Function request fields.

The remote search contract has one lexical branch over database-owned `extracted_md`. Foundry therefore emits one `lexical_weight` (default `0.8`) plus `semantic_weight` (default `0.2`) and forwards no second lexical control.

```bash
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-identity-preflight-query-audit \
  --index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-query-audit
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-identity-preflight-run \
  --index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-run \
  --only-pending
```

If a later AI patch or deterministic cleanup changes the current process/flow rows, rebuild and rerun identity preflight for the exact patched rows. Pass the original full index as `--source-index` so refreshed requests inherit the original `source_file` trace context; then merge that refreshed current-scope index back into the original full index so dependency evidence is preserved:

```bash
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-identity-preflight-requests-build \
  --type process \
  --rows-file .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/rows/processes.patched.jsonl \
  --source-index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-refresh
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-identity-preflight-query-audit \
  --index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-refresh/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-refresh-query-audit
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-identity-preflight-run \
  --index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-refresh/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-refresh-run
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-identity-preflight-index-merge \
  --base-index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --update-index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-refresh/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --out-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-index-merge
```

9. Run Foundry curation:

```bash
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-curation-gate \
  --type <process|flow|lifecyclemodel> \
  --rows-file <rows.jsonl> \
  --schema-report <dataset-validate-report.json> \
  --qa-report <qa-report.json> \
  --schema-file <context/schema.json> \
  --yaml-file <context/methodology.yaml> \
  --ruleset-file <context/runtime-ruleset.json> \
  --queue-dir .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/curation-queue \
  --classification-queue .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/classification-authoring-queue.jsonl \
  --location-queue .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/location-authoring-queue.jsonl \
  --identity-preflight-index .foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --require-identity-preflight \
  --profile <generic|bafu|custom-profile-id>
```

The classification and location queue files may be empty, but when they exist they must be passed through so taxonomy and `tidas_locations_category.json` blockers enter the AI authoring package. For process/flow imports, the identity-preflight index must also be passed through; full-context process/flow profiles automatically block AI authoring on missing or pending current/dependency identity results until the runner has produced evidence. Foundry also attaches the bundled TIDAS category schemas and location schema as full-text contract context so AI decisions can cite the taxonomy it used. Decision task build must return a ready status before AI authoring; `blocked_missing_full_context` means schema, methodology YAML, runtime ruleset, category/location schema, identity-preflight evidence, authoring package, or converted row payload context is incomplete and must be fixed first. The same full-context rule applies to non-decision authoring tasks built from curation-gate packages; a `blocked_missing_full_context` task manifest is not valid AI input.

Before choosing one of the AI authoring paths below, run `node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-authoring-plan --curation-gate-report <dataset-curation-gate-report.json>`. The plan is read-only: it aggregates identity/classification/location/field-patch readiness, points to missing task builds or deterministic apply commands, emits `rows_chain` for the required classification/location/patch/identity row lineage, and prevents skipping from a blocked curation gate directly to write planning. When `rows_chain` is present, run chained commands in order and rerun the plan after each deterministic apply so downstream evidence is bound to the current rows file.

10. If curation is blocked on identity manual-review action items, Codex/skills should output structured identity decisions only from a ready `identity-decision-task.json`, preserve each template decision's `decision_status=completed`, `authoring_package`, `authoring_package_sha256`, `used_context_kinds`, structured `evidence`, and `closes_action_items`, then apply them through `node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-identity-decisions-apply` with the matching `--authoring-package-dir` whenever the package directory is available. `reuse_existing_reference` must include canonical id/version. Product/process rows may choose `create_new` only with full candidate evidence. Elementary flow rows must choose `reuse_existing_reference` or `block_unresolved` by default; they may choose `create_new` only when the current task authorization explicitly permits account-local elementary candidates and the decision binds same-owner `state_code=0`, full identity evidence, private closure, and exclusion from the global LCIA cache. Do not patch row JSON directly for identity decisions.
11. If curation is blocked on classification queue rows, Codex/skills should output structured classification decisions only from a ready `classification-decision-task.json`, preserve each template decision's `decision_status=completed` and `authoring_context.context_bundle_sha256`, then apply them through `node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-classification-decisions-apply --decision-task <classification-decision-task.json>`. Large queues may be split with `--dataset-type`, `--bundle-id`/`--process-id`, `--limit`, `--offset`, and `--chunk-label`; use one `--shared-context-cache-dir` across chunks so repeated schema/YAML/category/location context is read from one stable bundle, and when decisions from multiple chunk tasks are applied to the source queue, pass every task with repeated `--decision-task`. Do not patch classification JSON directly when the classification decision workflow is available.
12. If curation is blocked on location queue rows, Codex/skills should output structured location decisions only from a ready `location-decision-task.json`, preserve each template decision's `decision_status=completed` and `authoring_context.context_bundle_sha256`, then apply them through `node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-location-decisions-apply --decision-task <location-decision-task.json>`. Large queues may be split with the same chunk flags and the same `--shared-context-cache-dir`; when decisions from multiple chunk tasks are applied to the source queue, pass every task with repeated `--decision-task`. Do not patch location fields directly when the location decision workflow is available.
13. For non-identity/non-classification/non-location curation blockers, first build explicit authoring tasks with `dataset-authoring-task-build`. Use the same `--shared-context-cache-dir` as decision tasks when rebuilding or splitting work so repeated schema/YAML/ruleset/category/location context is read from one stable bundle. The manifest must be `ready_for_ai_authoring_batch`; if it is `blocked_missing_full_context`, fix the missing schema/YAML/ruleset/category/location/source-row context before Codex/skills write patches. AI patch files must declare `patch_status=completed`; `dataset-authoring-patch-collect` rechecks full-context readiness from the manifest/tasks, verifies any referenced shared-context bundle still exists with the recorded stable `sha256`, and blocks stale, draft, incomplete, or non-completed task artifacts. Do not write the database directly from AI output.
14. Apply identity decisions, classification decisions, location decisions, patches, or build plans through deterministic CLI/SDK paths, then rerun schema, QA, queue build when references changed, and curation.
15. Run cleanup after source trace has been captured in authoring packages:

```bash
node scripts/foundry.ts dataset-curation-cleanup \
  --type <process|flow|lifecyclemodel> \
  --rows-file <rows.jsonl> \
  --source-rows-file <original-source-rows.jsonl> \
  --out-file <cleaned-rows.jsonl>
```

Use `--source-rows-file` for process scopes when the import source row may itself be output-only. Cleanup may generate deterministic `tiangongfoundry:sourceExchangeCompleteness` proof only if the source row is output-only and the final row preserves the non-flow-reference exchange signature.

Cleanup validates every targeted `common:timeStamp` / `common:dateOfLastRevision` before applying any transform. Accepted values have full seconds and `Z` or an existing-compatible `±HH:MM` offset; Gregorian date, clock, and offset components must round-trip exactly. UTC normalization preserves exact source bytes when conversion would leave the four-digit year grammar. Partial dates, missing timezone, sentinels, non-strings, or impossible components produce `blocked_invalid_datetime_metadata`, a nonzero CLI exit, ordered blocker evidence, and no cleaned rows. A blocked rerun never removes a pre-existing artifact. A retained default output adds `stale_cleanup_artifact_not_invalidated`; explicit outputs stay untouched and are not referenced by the blocked report. Do not consume `files.cleaned_rows` unless status is `completed`, blockers are empty, and the path is non-null. Post-authoring finalize runs parent cleanup before nested source/contact support finalization; on failure it preserves and reports every stale downstream artifact, writes the blocked import ledger, and may not run identity preflight, queue, schema, QA, location audit, dry-run, mutation manifest, or handoff. Repair into a new output path or archive stale evidence deliberately outside the blocked command.

16. Revalidate cleaned rows before dry-run/publish planning. For every final write scope, including mixed support rows and process/flow/lifecyclemodel rows, run the post-authoring finalizer so `pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset classification audit --type location` checks schema-derived location-code fields against `tidas_locations_category.json`; `counts.location_audit_blockers` must be `0`.
17. The post-authoring mutation manifest must prove reference closure before commit handoff. For mutually-referencing writable support records, use one mixed `--type support` scope so its closure is proven exactly and the rows are committed through `pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset save-draft --type auto`. Every profile may include generated contact/source rows. An adapter may additionally pass the explicit `--mint-unmatched-fp-ug-support` flag only when its current task authorization permits canonical-cache-miss FP/UG candidates; Unit Groups must precede Flow Properties in that support scope. The BAFU private candidate-registry/guarded owner-draft path remains a separate profile-specific mechanism. Dependent process/flow/lifecyclemodel scopes wait until support commit and readback succeed, while independent ready scopes may continue. Flow Properties and Unit Groups reuse `specs/canonical-support/flow-properties-unit-groups.json` public rows by default, and account-local candidates must never enter that public cache. Bundle materialization must pass `--block-on-unscaled-canonical-support` when the task requires strict scale proof: known finite positive non-1 factors remain `canonical_support_amount_scaling_required`, while missing, non-finite, zero, or negative factors remain `canonical_support_amount_scale_unresolved`; both must survive in scaling JSONL, the command report, and process-scope ledger before a canonical UUID rewrite can erase source-unit evidence. If the current task authorization explicitly permits account-local support and no acceptable public row exists, only same-owner `state_code=0` FP/UG references may proceed through its reviewed generic or profile-specific guarded path; public and private targets must never be mixed in one alias batch. Source rows in the support scope must be true reports, publications, or traceable source records; `ILCD format`, `Not specified`, data-format, and compliance-system identities are blocked as source rows and should remain only as canonical reference rewrites/provenance. True source rows must not keep empty or type-only descriptions such as `Report`; Foundry repairs those from citation/name evidence during bundle materialization. Missing `annualSupplyOrProductionVolume` source evidence is not deferred to `common:other`; Foundry preserves real evidence byte-semantically and in order, never invents a quantity from a reference flow or a default unit, and normalizes a genuinely unknown volume to the supported empty array `[]` with a row-level evidence gap bound to the row identity, field, and pre/post payload hashes. If final rows contain `common:other.tiangongfoundry:*` trace, the manifest must prove same-row AI patch evidence created or accepted that trace, or a matching deterministic cleanup proof for source-only-output exchange completeness; identity/classification/location decisions alone cannot authorize trace入库. References outside the exact write scope must either already exist in the remote account/public library as proven by `dataset verify-remote`, or their writable rows must be written in an earlier scope and verified before the dependent process/flow/lifecyclemodel scope can proceed. Any blocked finalize must write an import ledger under `--ledger-dir` or the finalize output directory, including `blocked.scopes.human-review.jsonl` plus categorized `blocked.dependencies.*.jsonl` rows with required human action and rerun path.
18. Remote writes require explicit task write policy, dry-run evidence, location-code audit evidence, reference-closure evidence, verification evidence, and a ready commit handoff. Human approval is required for policy changes and exceptional waivers, not for every gate-passing batch when the task policy allows automated commit.
19. When restarting after a successful post-authoring finalize, reuse existing finalize artifacts only if the report is current for the exact rows file, the mutation manifest and full-context proof still pass, and a fresh `dataset-commit-handoff-plan` is generated. Foundry does not own direct database mutation; the handoff plan exposes the CLI commands that a CLI/skill maintenance or publish workflow must execute under the approved account context, followed by post-write verify, closeout, and task completion reporting.
20. After `dataset-commit-handoff-plan` has proven every final-row `common:other.tiangongfoundry:unresolvedTrace` / `sourceExchangeCompleteness` entry matches the retained trace queue JSONL, the batch runner may execute the generated commit CommandSpec for that exact scope when the task write policy permits automated commit. Then execute the post-write verify CommandSpec and run `dataset-post-write-closeout` for each committed write scope; both specs and both reports must bind the same final rows bytes from handoff, profile-required full schema/YAML/context AI proof and evidence counts must still be attached, closeout must recheck the same trace queue coverage for later database-side curation, and successful closeout must append `ok.*.verified.jsonl` import-ledger rows. A foreign or RLS-hidden `state_code=0` reference reported as `missing_dataset` stays blocked; no trusted-reference allowlist or cross-account observation may rewrite it to passed. Production-test account cases accept no normalized difference.
21. A task with committed scopes is done only after `dataset-import-completion-report` aggregates every required closeout, rechecks profile-required full-context proof for every scope, and reports `completed`. For resumable batch work, also run `dataset-import-ledger-report --ledger-dir <task-import-ledger-dir>` so `resume.skipped-verified.jsonl` and `resume.plan.jsonl` separate already imported rows from human-review blockers before the next rerun.
22. Move `tasks/active/<task>.md` to `tasks/done/` only through `task-complete --completion-report <dataset-import-completion-report.json>`, so the task id, closeout scope, and profile-required full schema/YAML/context AI completion proof are checked before the file state changes.

Production case TDD is deliberately separate from the numbered import lane and ordinary `pnpm test`. `pnpm case:production:contact-draft` may use every capability granted to the designated test account only within that account's isolated, unreviewed, unpublished data. It may read public production data for search/readback quality, but it must not mutate public, foreign, or shared rows and must not invoke review or publish transitions. The case requires POSIX private storage, an owner-private env file, a repository-local git-ignored per-run output with no symlink parent, a fresh intent-bound identity receipt before production reads, and another before its single new contact owner-draft mutation. Windows fails closed until user-exclusive ACL verification exists. A missing/malformed/stale receipt, nonzero child exit, secret-bearing artifact, runtime/artifact hash drift, foreign accepted difference, ambiguous mutation, or non-unique readback stops the case without an automatic write retry.

Rows remain source-language before import. Bilingual completion is a separate post-import task only when requested.

## Incremental Release Lane

When the task imports a newer release over existing owner-draft rows, do not restart the whole authoring/write path by default:

1. Project the old release and new release into one SHA-bound comparison row per canonical target; keep UUID/crosswalk decisions outside the composer and auditable.
2. Capture one SELECT-only owner snapshot plus receipt and bind project, owner, `state_code=0`, exact target set, non-root field allowlists, query/deployment fingerprints, CLI version, and evidence-bound policy hashes in `foundry-incremental-change-set-request.v1`.
3. Run `dataset-incremental-change-set-compose` once into a fresh directory. Review its INSERT/UPDATE/NOOP/HOLD algebra and verify that conversion-event rows equal schema-valid input rows, event/decision/output hashes and chain pass, all dispatch counts are zero, absent dependencies are held, and every emitted action dependency points backward.
4. Keep ordinary conflicts or missing dependencies on HOLD while independent actions remain eligible. Any owner/state/scope/hash trust-boundary finding rejects activation globally.
5. Perform a fresh SELECT-only reconciliation and fresh owner session, obtain independent review, and admit the exact manifest/rows/contract with `execution-capsule-admit`.
6. For a completed reviewer-facing delivery package, run `final-delivery-promote` with a `foundry-final-delivery-manifest.v1` file and a fresh output directory. Treat the resulting detached seal as offline local validation evidence only; it authorizes no publication, deployment, or remote mutation and is not an execution capsule. The exact contract is `docs/final-delivery-promotion-contract.md`.
7. Only after separate execution authorization, pass `dataset-save-draft-input.jsonl` and `dataset-save-draft-execution-contract.json` to the published CLI. The CLI owns transactions, attempt records, no-replay recovery, and exact owner readback.

Every valid comparison row must have one terminal event even when its outcome is NOOP or HOLD. A full rewrite is not a recovery mechanism for incremental conflicts.

## Topology Convergence Lane

Use this lane when the candidate release merges, splits, adds, or retires flow identities:

1. Bind candidate flow/process file indexes, audited target classifications, exact flow mappings, approved language overlays, and canonical support identities to the candidate package SHA.
2. Capture one fresh owner-session SELECT-only census for all owner processes/flows plus visible public and foreign target flows. Bind the census, zero guards, deployment/RPC/query fingerprints, and fixed published CLI fingerprint in the admission receipt.
3. Run `dataset-topology-convergence-compose` into a fresh directory. Require exact candidate-flow/process/exchange and change-count algebra, complete target reference closure, independent audit PASS, and P0=P1=0.
4. Admit and execute F first. Exact-read the complete target flow closure before admitting P. P reconstructs exchanges only by `(process UUID, source exchange number, occurrence)` while preserving current non-exchange content and approved languages.
5. After P exact readback, recapture all visible process inbound references. Convert only unique owner/state-zero, zero-inbound D candidates into a delete-only maintenance plan. Public, foreign, nonzero, or unknown targets never enter that plan.
6. Seal every conversion/no-write/execution/readback event and final full-graph audit. Foundry stays offline; protected transactions, attempt consumption, ambiguity recovery, and no-replay behavior belong to the fixed CLI.

The complete contract is `docs/topology-convergence-contract.md`.

## Maintainer Validation

The pre-push hook runs the complete source qualification for code updates, branch creation, tags, mixed pushes and unproven input. Only a complete Git pre-push stream consisting entirely of valid existing branch deletions skips Node/toolchain loading and `pnpm prepush:gate`: it publishes no source. Missing or failed classification falls back to the original gate, and terminal input never waits for an EOF. This is not permission to delete a branch; the operator still verifies ownership, merge/integration completion and the exact remote head.

Golden comparisons retain isolated source snapshots and frozen dependency installs. Matching package-manager pins may reuse only the verified pnpm content store and Corepack tool cache, with installation scripts disabled and store integrity checks enabled. This avoids repeated dependency downloads without inheriting operator configuration, credentials or `node_modules`; the compared commands still receive identical isolated environments.

Docpact requires `test/unit/zero-javascript-ratchet.test.mts` to exist; the normal test gate verifies its executable assertions. Review the TypeScript boundary in the governed documents and record their review metadata. Do not add review-only comments to executable tests for a version bump. Release-only PRs retain the exact version projections and permitted document review metadata; governance rule changes land in a separate source PR first.

Foundry tests are organized by behavior layer, not by historical incident number:

- `test/unit/` for pure metadata and contract helpers.
- `test/commands/` for one-command artifact and report contracts.
- `test/scenarios/` for multi-command import workflows and gate behavior.
- `test/fixtures/` for shared Foundry row, report, command, and workflow-specific fixture helpers split by behavior surface.

Use `pnpm test` for the full suite, `pnpm test:unit`, `pnpm test:commands`, and `pnpm test:scenarios` for targeted behavior, and `pnpm test:toolchain` for the pnpm/TS7 contract. New tests should be named after the behavior they protect rather than `full-context-gate-N`. Each typed migration slice starts with a failing characterization or real case, then passes the focused test, full suite, and clean arbitrary-worktree gate.
