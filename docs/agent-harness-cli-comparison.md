# Acceptance Loop Notes

Foundry keeps a lightweight acceptance loop so agent work is inspectable through artifacts rather than chat summaries.

Useful pattern:

- task-specific contracts live under `specs/acceptance/` when a task needs an explicit artifact checklist;
- deterministic checks write JSON reports under `.foundry/state/`;
- the Codex Stop hook runs `pnpm acceptance:check`;
- blocking failures point the agent at concrete missing or inconsistent files.

The pnpm/TS7 migration extends the same evidence model: `pnpm test:toolchain` checks the single lock/compiler graph and permanent compatibility ratchets, while a clean arbitrary-worktree run proves the project did not borrow dependencies, credentials, or ignored runtime state from the developer checkout. Issue #70 additionally proves exact CLI 0.1.3 public batch/auth consumption without changing acceptance-loop authority or artifact locations.

`scripts/commands/core.ts` owns the local acceptance aggregation invoked by the existing package script. Its TypeScript migration preserves workflow, storage, environment and surface-check order plus the same `.foundry/state/acceptance/latest.json` artifact; it does not change Stop-hook registration or introduce a remote check.

Run:

```bash
pnpm acceptance:check
```

The loop checks `.env.example` policy on every run. Task-specific artifact contracts are optional; when `specs/acceptance/` has no JSON contracts, the acceptance loop only runs repository policy checks.
