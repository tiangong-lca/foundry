# Foundry Task Contracts

The v2 task store is implemented by `foundry-task-registration.ts`, `foundry-task-store.ts`, `foundry-task-io.ts` and `foundry-task-types.ts`. It keeps source/profile/task identity separate from permissions and reuses the published CLI's `withBatchRunLock` for local metadata transactions. It does not perform database mutations or replace the CLI's consumed-attempt/readback recovery contract.

The earlier v1 examples at commit `ad9c885dde64b22f6e0a8e17f9da46bdba5345ef` remain historical input for W10. Existing unregistered directories, v1 jobs, locks and attempts are never relabeled as v2 automatically. Real task #95 remains outside migration scope.

Installing or verifying `@tiangong-lca/foundry` does not create, migrate or relabel task state. Package descriptor/file identity becomes the runtime facts recorded by newly created jobs. Existing jobs whose package identity differs require the explicit compatibility/migration path; a new package directory cannot reset their source, authorization, artifact or attempt ledgers.

```

Workspace registration retains the complete intended job/source/profile/seed metadata and a content digest. The task-local copies must match it. Account intent and approved grants also have separate immutable workspace registrations. These records contain no passwords, access tokens or session contents.

The optional task-start brief belongs to the immutable facade request revision. It keeps bounded original user wording, goal, intended use, scope, deliverables, user constraints and distinct AI assumptions. An absent brief remains absent in older v1 fingerprints. It is projected for the caller and semantic authoring as task context, but it is not a selected data source, a scientific proof, or an authorization grant.

Local native-import and CLI context-pack stages use the existing operation plan, receipt and artifact index. A successful repeated stage reuses its checked receipt. Native output is inspected before registration; CLI context runs in a fresh task-contained generation so its file references remain valid. Interrupted unindexed generations are not accepted as completed stages. Neither conversion nor context readiness supplies content acceptance, identity or write authority.

Row materialization and assessment also use this local transaction. Materialized rows preserve domain payloads and row metadata, normalize typed API payload wrappers to the CLI-compatible `json` slot, and retain a producer chain to the original selected seed or primary native dataset. Original wrappers remain in the frozen source; bundled copies are excluded from row selection. Assessment reads only selected indexed rows/context, then registers native validation, local QA, queue, curation and authoring outputs. Its report records the owner's resolution base for relative references. Pending work is a current artifact state, not permission to execute a rendered command or dispatch a remote write.

The public assessment advances one dataset type per resume and records cumulative coverage. A prior set is reusable only while its row file, schema/QA/curation/authoring artifacts, contract pack, process closure queue and applicable task/type interaction digest still match current registered facts. An object-only answer or assumption changes that object's live authoring context and semantic ID gate without making another Process set or work item stale; a task-wide item affects every set. Row revisions still require current assessment of their changed type, while independently unchanged rows retain their identity and cannot inherit another object's choice. Each new generation binds the previous report and retains source receipts for reused outputs. An `in_progress` report is visible for prompt human follow-up and independent work, but cannot prove finalization or completion. A pending question before rows exist still permits independently registered native import, contract context and row materialization; a pending question before explicit cleanup permits that one local preparation. Repeated resume after local work is exhausted retains the same indexed evidence and cannot enter account or owner-write stages.

A valid CLI curation queue may be `blocked` with exit 1. Assessment binds that report to the current registered row paths and hashes, verifies the bounded queue output tree, then indexes its manifest, blocker JSONL and closure files before projecting a concise missing-reference explanation. Schema, QA and curation may still record other local findings; blocked queue closure and its full Flow IDs remain visible evidence, never permission, waiver or completion. Changed selected source files create a new request revision rather than editing the frozen task, while independent row types can retain their assessed receipts.

`dataset-workflow-interaction` uses the same metadata lock, immutable output generation and hash-chained index. Its selected input descriptor binds task, actor and current interaction-state SHA; question, raw answer, interpreted decision and AI assumption events are append-only. Task/type-wide events retain their v1 meaning. An optional `object_scope` on a question or assumption binds one explicit type/id/version and the hash of exactly one current registered row; an answer inherits that scope. Input parsing and the task lock reject missing, duplicate, changed or caller-invented row bindings. The current `interaction-state.json` supplies per-object authoring context and exact semantic decision IDs, without mutating frozen source, granting write authority or clearing a consumed attempt. Patch work binds one assessed object. Classification/location decision owners derive every target identity from the registered task and queue, verify applicable IDs over the batch and record adoption per object; unresolved questions in the target batch block it, while disjoint work continues. Identity rewrites that cannot preserve an actively reviewed object or may indirectly rewrite its references fail closed for separate review. A semantic result records each work item and exact before/after row hashes when it cites a scoped decision. A later row differs from the question's proof only through a matching indexed decision-bound successor; other changes or assumptions on the old row need targeted review. Every current object answer needs its own indexed adoption before completion or write handoff. During local assessment, an initial answer still permits independent preparation; a new answer after earlier indexed object work immediately needs scoped reassessment, including a corrected answer or a replacement question and even when the prior row transition was a no-op. Facade, authorization, prepared-approval continuation and owner execution recheck the current interaction under their locks. An indexed authorization freezes later interaction edits; a changed choice then needs a separately reviewed task revision. The user-facing `decision_recap` identifies object scope and applied row successors, while `completion_proven` remains false until current completion proof. It is not a second task truth source.

Identity preflight runs its qualified, account-bound remote reads before a local transaction captures the resulting files. Each capture has a distinct invocation identity and rechecks current rows under the task lock; the receipt cannot replay a query. A completed identity report binds the current row manifest and its combined preflight index, invalidating earlier assessments until curation consumes that index. Failed reads retain diagnostics and can be retried by a later resume; status remains read-only over stored files. Current-account write admission still requires fresh identity and separate authorization.

Facade request indexes map one explicit request id to retained task revisions. The request key binds workspace id plus request id; a revision fingerprint binds the strict task-start spec and ordered canonical source path/bytes/SHA facts. Task ids include the complete request SHA-256 plus the revision ordinal, avoiding a shorter cross-request namespace. A changed source path or content, actor/account, lane/profile/entity scope, seed or preparation creates a predecessor-bound task rather than editing the prior job. Same-fingerprint concurrent starts serialize through the CLI-owned lock and return the same task bytes. The immutable task pointer names one exact revision record; status never locates authority by scanning task directories. If a host stops after publishing a task but before appending its request revision, only the original spec can complete that interrupted registration; a different retry returns `facade_crash_recovery_conflict` and identifies the deterministic task id.

## Task creation and recovery

Public authorization result records identify the current finalization, concrete input scope, grant/pointer digests, expiry and optional sealed handoff/capsule. The grant and approval snapshots remain owned by the existing authorization registry. State projection uses only a matching active pointer, current finalization and unexpired result; it is not execution admission. Registration and snapshot sealing never run a database command, and duplicate current approval reuses the recorded result.

An approved preparation continuation records its source approval digest in the new finalization. This retained relationship permits recovery when the derived grant has activated but the sealed-result capture was interrupted. The continuation independently reloads current authority, validates the original grant and exact successor content, and proves row lineage before sealing. A stale or unrelated active grant cannot be substituted. Producer indexing is shared by input verification and explicit ancestry proof, retaining all candidate order and earlier-sequence checks within each call.

Semantic submissions bind current assessment and work-item digests independently of their supplied files. Accepted input, its projected collection manifest, local CLI result and new row manifest enter the same receipt/index lineage. A blocked application may retain a diagnostic output but publishes no new current-row manifest. Current row selection follows the latest registered row-manifest producer, and an assessment is current only for those row files. The semantic transaction checks current selection again while holding the task lock; it cannot publish a stale result after another submission advanced the task.

Identity application adds retained `identity_reports` and `identity_rewrite_reports` to current row manifests. These reports preserve source rows, reference-only partitions and dependent rewrites when local write candidates shrink to zero; zero candidates alone never proves completion. Failed/unresolved application keeps its diagnostic artifacts without replacing current rows. Assessment reads only selected report facts and passes their existing owner evidence into curation.

Producer lookup builds a verification-local index keyed by resolved path, content digest and byte count. It retains original index order and the strict earlier-sequence requirement. Paths, original source bytes, producer receipts/plans and selected artifact bytes are still validated; the lookup is discarded after each verification and is not a cross-operation trust cache.

Finalization captures existing owner outputs in a distinct generation after read-only work. It uses current row-manifest ancestry to select semantic reports and retains their originals. Fresh per-type identity request/output paths prevent legacy refresh logic from rewriting already indexed evidence; dependency entries are preserved and execution is limited to the current type. The capture verifies selected lineage before reads and current rows under the lock. A `foundry-finalize.json` record is current only for its exact rows and assessment, and repeated pending resume does not rerun finalization. A ready record requests authorization and is not a completed task or mutation receipt.

`foundry-job.json` uses `tiangong-foundry.job.v2`. It binds workspace/task/actor/request identity, lane, target profile/entity types, source/profile/optional seed content references, current runtime manifest/entry identity, UTC creation time, and the default `write_policy` of `dry-run` with remote state 0. Task metadata cannot enable a remote write by changing that policy object. Actual permission requires the separate reviewed authorization/execution boundary.

Creation validates selected source bytes and package profile before writing. It builds complete metadata in an owned private staging directory, saves an immutable workspace registration, and publishes the task directory by rename. A publication receipt must exist before operations proceed. A registration without a published task may complete only the same interrupted initialization. Once publication is recorded, a missing task directory is a recovery/audit condition; it must not be recreated with empty operation or attempt history. Missing publication evidence over existing outputs/attempts is ambiguous and remains blocked.

Changed actor, task, workspace, request, profile or target entity intent is rejected. Runtime or profile changes require the pinned version or an explicit migration; they cannot silently invalidate earlier attempts. Same-task local metadata operations serialize under one CLI-owned lock. The lock protects metadata, not permission: acquiring it grants no data authority.

## Frozen inputs and profile

`source-manifest.json` uses `tiangong-foundry.source-manifest.v2` and records the original canonical selected file paths, byte sizes and SHA-256 values, along with workspace/task identity. Current original sources must still match their frozen facts. Unavailable or changed sources require restoration or an explicit new revision. A new revision must retain previous mutation/attempt authority as required by W10; this store does not reset it.

`profile-lock.json` uses `tiangong-foundry.profile-lock.v2` and preserves the selected raw profile and its digest. The lock bytes must match both the registered job reference and the current package's profile. Historical profile authorization flags are not current permission.

The source-evidence lane additionally requires a retained `seed-manifest.json`. The W05 `task-start.v1` spec requires the JSON seed to be one of the independently selected source files. Intake freezes it but does not claim semantic completeness; storing a seed alone does not prove it is ready for authoring.

## Local operation plans and receipts

The first admitted transaction is deterministic local `dataset-curation-cleanup`. Remote mutations, network-driven work and batch execution must not be routed through its replay path.

An operation id binds job bytes, command, exact selected input facts and normalized options. Its immutable plan retains a fixed operation time, so interrupted deterministic preparation can reproduce its artifacts without overwriting prior bytes. A successful operation records all output facts and the exact returned report, then atomically updates `artifact-index.jsonl`. Repeating the same request reads only the matching completed local receipt and revalidates outputs; it does not rerun the command or append duplicate records.

Existing CLI-generated stage files use an internal transaction capability that records their facts without creating or replacing file bytes. The existing sorted-child, depth-first walk retains containment, regular-file/link checks and the 9,998-file limit. Capture requires an active transaction, current workspace writer selection, matching Task/job/runtime/profile and current source/input lineage at its verification boundaries. Every selected output is resolved and freshly read twice; only a complete matching batch updates the operation's output map, in the original roster order. Task control and consumed-marker paths are excluded. Ordinary `writeText`/`writeJson` retain their per-write admission and immutable-byte behavior, and only `writeJson` can register the exact returned JSON report. Final input verification, receipt replay and index-prefix/CAS publication are unchanged.

This capture phase executes no business command. Runtime inventories are checked at capture boundaries rather than before each existing file; no facts or hashes are reused across operations. Those samples do not guarantee observation of a transient change restored between them or an atomic snapshot against arbitrary same-user filesystem mutation. Persistent writer/runtime/input drift and differences between the fresh output captures refuse completion and retain unindexed stage files.

A completed _operation receipt_ means its local invocation produced recorded output. It does not mean the business task is completed or that a blocked cleanup report passed its gates. The facade must interpret the actual result and required completion/readback evidence.

## Artifact lineage

The v2 JSONL index records sequence, previous record digest, operation/command/input-scope identity, producer receipt reference, task-relative artifact path, byte size and SHA-256. The index points to artifacts; it does not copy payloads. It is replaced atomically under the metadata lock, with previous-byte comparison and bounded size. Truncated, malformed or changed chains are rejected.

A derived input must match an indexed output. Its completed producer receipt and plan must match the same job and content digests; every ancestor must lead through earlier index entries to frozen original source. The lineage walk verifies every receipt and plan again and explores every matching earlier producer, so reproducing identical output bytes cannot hide another valid ancestry path. Arbitrary files placed under `outputs/` do not become trusted inputs. Changing a parent receipt or plan invalidates continuation. Current selected input bytes are checked again, including before a local operation receipt is finalized.

## Account and authorization

Account registration optionally stores `account_mode` from explicit task/host intent. Omitted legacy records retain their bytes and mean ordinary; production-test records cannot be downgraded on the same task. Request fingerprints and migration task templates retain an explicit mode. This verification policy grants no additional write action.

An expected account may be selected after local preparation. The first selection is registered as project/user intent; subsequent disagreement is rejected. A missing task-local account file may only be restored from its existing workspace registration. This is intent, not proof of authentication.

`verifyFoundryRuntimeIdentity` invokes the exact installed CLI through executable/argv in a fresh private CWD with a restricted environment. The CLI owns OAuth/session refresh and server identity verification. Returned proof is immutable, process-local and bound to workspace/task/actor/runtime, with a 60-second freshness check at permission admission. Serialized proof is not reusable authority. Headless mode uses the CLI's existing explicit target and process-only access token, with cache disabled and no token persistence. CLI 0.1.17 reports no token-expiry timestamp for that mode; Foundry does not invent one or claim a separately verified token lifetime.

`registerFoundryTaskAuthorization` is an explicit host approval operation. It requires fresh identity, current task/input lineage, a valid W03 grant, and independently selected evidence facts supplied by the trusted caller. The grant cannot select its own evidence paths. Each original evidence file is rechecked and copied into an immutable task snapshot; the grant and selection are registered in workspace state. Updating `authorization.json` uses compare-and-swap against its prior digest and preserves historical grants. Unknown legacy authorization files are not overwritten.

`loadFoundryTaskAuthorization` rechecks live identity, task registration, input lineage, active pointer/registration, grant expiry/scope and both evidence snapshots and originals. A previous grant cannot be relabeled for changed or derived inputs. Reusing its approval requires a qualified, process-local derivation that proves ancestry, changes only the input digest, retains authority bounds and records `authorization-derivation.v1` evidence. The active parent pointer is checked around preparation and captured for later compare-and-swap. A separately reviewed approval may instead register the exact derived bytes directly. Login, task creation, local preparation and an empty grant never grant publication, deletion or restricted write actions.

A repair scope (`input_kind: repair_rows`) has no finalization: its authority is the registered preparation report. The approval descriptor names that report digest, carries the selected native execution contract, and is admitted only for Process rows of the locked `generic` profile. Activation re-reads the exact registered report entry, requires one prepared dispatching-write-free scope (`status: prepared`, zero remote writes, not publication ready), re-derives the native contract's canonical digest over the unchanged candidate rows, matches every reported action against the signed contract, and binds the grant to the candidate bytes as the approved input scope. The sealed stage writes a repair handoff plan whose commit and post-write-verify CommandSpecs bind the candidate rows and that contract, then seals the execution capsule for the reviewed commit-handoff command. State projection keeps such an approval current only while the same preparation entry, active pointer and expiry hold, and a no-change or blocked preparation never reaches authorization. Owner execution request preparation, dispatch and closeout remain separate stages. Repair execution re-admits the registered preparation before dispatch and readback. Its verified result binds the same preparation, the consumed native contract receipt and exact root/reference proof, preserving false publication readiness. The source candidate may remain an independently captured selected input; only that exact input fact can use the source-input verification path, while receipt, readback and all other result files remain task-contained outputs.

Repair reference proofs bind complete before/candidate payload hashes and every reference occurrence to the CLI JSONL checks. Exact existing historical references may be retained with their raw freshness blockers and a separately indexed integrity proof; a newer version never authorizes reference retargeting. Both preflight and closeout preserve false publication readiness, exact input-path binding and strict root owner/state/content checks. Normal authoring reference-quality policy is unchanged.

A repair revision may follow an attempted predecessor only through the bounded no-dispatch successor rule: the successor names the predecessor task and the exact digest of that predecessor's producer-registered terminal CLI report, and the predecessor's own hash-chained evidence must prove an unresolved definite failure with zero executed actions, zero consumed CLI attempts, no unknown outcome, only definite failed or blocked rows, one consumed scope bound to that report, and the same request, actor, account, lane, generic profile and entity identities/versions. The successor must submit genuinely different candidate bytes on new immutable paths, inherits no grant, and is re-derived on every start, status and resume read, so a descendant can never be admitted by one path and refused by another. Every other predecessor state keeps the original readback-required refusal.

Before a restricted child handoff, the runtime stores a content-addressed `execution-context.v1` under task evidence. A new process must reconstruct the context, qualification and identity, then recheck source ancestry, final bytes, current authorization/QA exceptions, owner CLI path and CommandSpec operation semantics. Only the verified spec is returned to the existing no-replay executor. The execution context never carries credentials and never clears or retries an attempt.

The public facade projects preparation, sealed approval, owner execution and independent readback through the result envelope. Before dispatch, the dedicated execution-consume operation registers an immutable `attempts/owner-v1/<scope>/consumed.json` output with producer evidence; other local operations cannot write task-control paths. Recognized consumed requests resume readback only, while unknown attempts remain blocked. Completion requires a current producer-backed completion report or verified current write scopes plus independent verification of all current canonical reference partitions. Inspect revalidates completion, execution requests, consumed markers, observations, owner results and canonical reference verification results against their exact producer plans, receipts and current bytes. A forged index entry borrowing another operation receipt cannot prove completion. No child command is inferred from a directory name.

The request store revalidates every predecessor's retained job against its publication and indexed identity before admitting a new revision or returning a descendant for status/resume. A nonempty predecessor attempt directory blocks the descendant and directs recovery to the original owner; its declared success/unknown state never clears the guard. Missing or altered predecessor state is an audit condition, not permission to reconstruct an empty history. This facade guard does not by itself establish complete migration history, cross-request inheritance or restricted execution admission.

Explicit migration preserves original records and creates current registrations only for independently admitted local preparation. The adoption callback remains pending and expires after preparation; activation anchors the archive and immutable current registrations. Read-only inspection can validate retained runtime/profile bytes without matching current write rules and without taking a write lock. Mutation admission rechecks retained dataset scope independently of new request/path/runtime labels; terminal or unresolved work is not a new executable task. Subsequent migration retains origin ids and rechecks later attempts. See the workspace migration contract for scope limitations and original-owner recovery.

## Compatibility history and initial reference evidence

Same-task adoption uses `state/task-runtime-adoptions/<task>.json` as its immutable first anchor and `workspaces/<task>/runtime-adoptions/<plan-sha>.json` as receipt storage. v2 successor links are created once under `state/task-runtime-adoptions/<task>/successors/<preceding-plan-sha>.json`. Plans bind the preceding digest, original registration/job, current witness, writer stop and independent compatibility evidence. They append to the existing Task protocol, not another task ledger. Complete descriptor/CLI inventories distinguish changed code whose legacy summary fields are identical. Original finalization/authorization/attempt history cannot be cleared by a transition.

Verified retained assessment views preserve old relative-locator meaning. They are distinct from current machine-gate coverage after adoption. Per-set authoring locators follow their registered assessment producer, while current contract/row/reference/interaction facts determine reusable current gates.

A Process-only `reference-input` selection reaches the initial queue and QA. Queue interfaces require every referenced version's complete Flow body UUID/version; wrapper metadata cannot invent one. Existing Flow/property/unit documents remain read-only. Current CLI validation receives a deterministic wrapper with selected semantic-context references, while native validation and authored rows retain the original Process payload. The receipt and status reader bind original rows, derived wrapper, selection and reference facts; byte drift or a changed selection invalidates affected coverage.

The retained identity recovery contract is in [the public runtime contract](public-runtime-contract.md#same-task-compatibility-and-retained-identity-diagnostics). Its original raw receipt, producer and independent CLI-inventory facts are mandatory; missing proof remains read-only UNKNOWN without a new query or original-record rewrite.

Explicit new read-only identity preparation and claims use `dataset-workflow-identity-stage-prepare` and `dataset-workflow-identity-stage-dispatch` through the existing native Task plan/receipt/index. Each target retains a version-bound directory and exact single-envelope owner snapshot while binding its original registered row group. Partial unindexed admission is retained as an orphan observation and never promoted into authenticated proof. The selected identity result remains `dataset-workflow-identity`; later ordinary assessment consumes its new index, while a blocked explicit stage cannot fall through into an ordinary random-nonce query. See the public explicit-stage contract.

The original CLI-managed package entry admits runtime adoption through an independently reviewed L=S+K carrier. Full executing component/launch/workspace equality establishes S ownership before unchanged native manifest and Task admission checks. Q references remain inventory-bound and branded in the executing package. Original job, registration, source/profile/seed/science, stopped-writer witness and consumed/UNKNOWN state are unchanged; no alternate business caller can substitute for original managed-entry acceptance.
