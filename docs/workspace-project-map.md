# Workspace Project Map

Migration transfer planning is governed by [the workspace migration contract](workspace-migration-contract.md). W10 provides explicit source/queue/input staging, current-owner task adoption, audited v2 activation and separate runtime read/write selection. Preserved history blocks replay across requests and migrations; none of these records grants business permission. Operational qualification and release integration remain tracked in #108/#980.

The v2 task store persists registered job/source/profile identity, account intent, producer receipts and artifact lineage; deterministic local retries reuse verified results. Exact C1/TIDAS qualification, all-command disposition, derived authorization and child admission form the W04 authority boundary. The W05 hierarchical facade now adds strict result/task schemas, deterministic request revisions, actor-bound status/resume, local preparation and read-only migration inventory. W06 owns the installable candidate closure; W08 owns F1 publication and platform components. See `docs/public-runtime-contract.md`, `docs/runtime-context-contract.md`, `docs/task-authorization-contract.md` and `docs/foundry-task-contracts.md`.

The explicit workspace runtime is defined by `docs/runtime-context-contract.md`: package layout comes from `package.json.foundryRuntime`, emitted execution needs no source TypeScript or Git, and selected inputs/task outputs are bound to an immutable runtime context. `scripts/runtime-entry.ts` now implements workspace init/migration, consumer doctor and task start/status/resume as the separate hierarchical facade. All 63 flat owner commands retain explicit public/internal/excluded, path, child, qualification and authorization dispositions; the facade reaches them only through registered task state and never falls back to the developer runner.

Import profiles distribute source rules only. Historical BAFU/USLCI/Worldsteel account overrides, QA waivers and the Worldsteel full-context relaxation grant no permission to a new task. `docs/task-authorization-contract.md` owns the separate workspace/task/actor/account/profile/input binding and exact action evidence. Local candidate preparation and checked public-reference proofs remain available; current final-row hashes, task permissions and all content/closure/no-replay gates are required before a restricted write handoff.

Foundry should route reusable work to the owning repository instead of copying implementation locally.

The Wave 26 library, classification, authoring, process-scope and batch modules are Foundry-local orchestrators. Their TypeScript migration changes navigation and static ownership only: shared CLI commands, profile policy, database behavior and sibling-project semantics remain with the owners listed below.

| Need | Owning project | Normal surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installed workspace/task facade, request revisions and local task evidence | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` | W06 candidate `tiangong-foundry workspace ...`, `doctor`, and `task start/status/resume`; W08 publishes F1 |
| Task-local goal, decision history, scoped reassessment and indexed recap source | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` for state and deterministic binding; `tiangong-lca-skills` for question/answer wording and recap prose | Optional task brief, `task resume --interaction-input`, explicit task/type/registered-object scope, per-object current authoring context and decision-bound row successors; CLI scientific and write gates remain separate |

| BAFU category-map completion and manual-review projection | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` for local closure/status/blockers; TIDAS schema and AI/human decisions retain vocabulary/choice ownership | `category-map-projection.ts` artifacts → `category-map-report.ts` closure report → command nonzero on any emitted manual review |
| Canonical multilingual description transport | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` for lossless local rewrite/reference/ledger projection; schema and semantic decision owners retain value/identity choice | `canonical-description.ts` validation/clone → library rewrite ledger → identity resolution/apply/carry-forward without display coercion |
| Post-finalize recovery command evidence | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` for exact local executable/argv dispatch and reader projection; CLI/database retain remote mutation/readback authority | one recovery helper → exact `{ executable, argv, display }` → logs/report path → fail before downstream stage on drift |
| Location task-queue continuity | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` for local path/bytes/SHA binding; TIDAS schema and location decision/apply tooling retain taxonomy/value semantics | task build → one queue discovery/fact → suggest → exact fact verify → apply only if unchanged |

| Foundry test structure and command navigation checks | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` | `test/README.md`, `test/unit`, `test/commands`, `test/scenarios`, `test/fixtures`, `scripts/lib/foundry-command-metadata.ts`, `scripts/lib/surface-audit.ts` |
| Foundry package/compiler, portable artifact I/O, and typed runtime | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` | Node.js 24, `pnpm@11.24.0`, TypeScript `7.0.2`, public-only package entry/API, sanitized staging manifest, descriptor-bound source-free closure, trusted source/emitted/package discovery, credential-free Golden comparison, zero-JavaScript ratchet and four-platform tests |
| Foundry-local surface cleanup | `tiangong-lca-data-foundry` | remove old aliases, empty command categories, and orphaned draft docs only after metadata, tests, docs, and docpact show no remaining consumer |

Before implementing a missing capability, classify it with `docs/capability-ownership-policy.md` and `specs/capability-ownership-rules.json`.
